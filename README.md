# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
Final Project for NYU Stern Data Bootcamp Class 

This project was completed by insert Annette Lee here in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para-phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the textand the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description
Unicorns are startups valued at over one billion dollars. The startup industry has been a booming one for the last ten years. As the number of startups grow, the valuations have grown to crazy amounts, even if the product is wildly unsuccessful. I thought it would be interesting to analyze the indicators of an unicorn startup and learn more about the characteristics of a billion dollar company. In the end, I hope to answer: What will the next billion-dollar start-up look like?
